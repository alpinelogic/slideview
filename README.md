Slideview.js
=========

Slideview is a tiny JS lib for responsive sliders (_<http://istocode.github.io/slideview/>_).

### Why another slider?
Because every content slider I have tried exeeds 1,000 lines of code. If you only need one feature instead of 99 and you want to support only modern Browsers (IE10+), then Slideview may work for you. IE9 can be supported simply by using any polyfill for the `classList` API.

If non-modern browsers are a concern, then try the Slideview jQuery plugin (_coming soon_).



### Features
* Tiny/lightweight lib (_a little over 250 lines of code for the VanillaJS version_).
* Sliding effect happens with a simple CSS transition.
* In contrast to many other sliders, Slideview.js uses percentages for all of its slides. You initialize Slideview once and the slides get resized by the Browser automatically.
* Easily stylable with CSS - no default styling is assumed!
* 2 separate libs: plain JavaScript & a jQuery plugin (_jquery plugin coming soon_).
* Free as in "free beer".
